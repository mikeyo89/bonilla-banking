User Story:

The system should have basic functionalities, such as login/logout, view accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, utilities, etc.

More specifically, customers with an online bank account should be able to log in to the system by entering a valid username
and password and log out of the system when they are done with their work.

Using View Account, customers can view up-to date balance information about deposits (saving/checking), credit cards, etc.

Customers can also view transaction history records with a maximum retention period of 180 days.

Transfer Funds allows customers to transfer funds between authorized personal accounts. The requested transfer takes place
immediately or at a selected future date specified by the customer. Customers are allowed to view and/or terminate pending transfers.

Customers can use the online bill payment service to pay their bills by debiting their account.

The payment is made to payee corporations that the customer has registered with internet banking by using the registered bill.
But with new payee corporations that the customer has not registered, this payment can be made immediately or at a specific date.

The utility allows customers to change passwords and the secure delivery contact information.

Customers can also change the personal information of their online profile.
